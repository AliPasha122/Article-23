This research proposes an AI-integrated dynamic Phase Change Material (PCM) system to
optimize household heating efficiency without compromising comfort. Current heating
systems struggle with energy wastage, high costs, and inadequate adaptability. Our solution
leverages AI-driven weather prediction algorithms and dynamic PCM layers that adjust
thermal storage and release based on real-time climate data. Preliminary simulations
indicate a potential 30-50% reduction in energy consumption, making it a viable and costeffective alternative.
